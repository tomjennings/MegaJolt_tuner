  this program edits advance bins, loads from file/saves to
  file (compatible with the official tuner program).

  text editor is "good enough for me". does not edit MAP bins or
  mappings.
  
  arrow keys select a cell for editing. 
  

  AUTOMATIC UPLOAD:
  
  the direct cell-modification commands below can be enabled to
  upload to the Megajolt immediately, without the U)pload

  note that auto-upload does only upload, not burn to flash.

  ENTER key edits that cell; + and - increment and decrement, 
  respectively. BACKSPACE erases to zero (do that to enter a 
  new value). ENTER again to end editing. (AUTO-uPLOAD).
